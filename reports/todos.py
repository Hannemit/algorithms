TODO: complete all the functions currently in sorting (Monday)
TODO: complete functions in finding_duplicates (Tuesday)
TODO: go on hackerrank, do at least 5 exercises, from now on do at least 3 every day (Wednesday and forever more).
    Also look a bit at leetcode and codewars, see which one is nicer (I think codewars is actually quite nice)
TODO: More sorting! the link below has (both of them actually) other sorting algorithms mentioned (Thursday)
TODO: Friday continue the sorting!!

TODO: Weekend --> Redo all sorting algorithms, write down their time and space complexities.
